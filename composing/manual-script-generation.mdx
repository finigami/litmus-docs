title: "Run Script"
description: "Execute custom Playwright code snippets within your test"
---

## Usecase

**Purpose:** This is a powerful, advanced action for users who need to run custom code snippets. It gives you direct access to the Playwright execution context, allowing you to perform complex actions, custom assertions, or page manipulations.

This option is available under the "Add an instruction" dropdown.

### Arguments

This action requires two inputs:

* **Enter Description here:** A plain-English overview of what your code does (e.g., "Fetches a value from local storage"). This is for your own reference to keep the test readable.
* **Enter your script here:** The actual Playwright-compatible JavaScript code you want to execute.
