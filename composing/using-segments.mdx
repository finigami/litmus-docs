Segments work just like reusable functions in a normal Playwright structure. They allow you to save a common portion of a test (like a "Login" or "Add to Cart" flow) and then reuse that set of steps in any other test.

## How to Create a Segment

Let's say you have a test called "Login Test" and you want to use those same login steps at the beginning of all your other tests.

1.  Navigate to the **Segments** tab in the main navigation.
2.  Click the **"Add Segment"** button.
3.  A pop-up will appear. First, give your new segment a clear name (e.g., "Login Flow").
4.  Next, select the test you want to build from (e.g., "Login Test") from the dropdown.
5.  Finally, choose the **Start Step** and the **End Step**. This tells the system that all steps *between* (and including) these two points will be saved as your reusable segment.
6.  Click **"Save"**.

## How to Use a Segment

Once your segment is saved, you can add it to any test.

1.  Go to the test where you want to use the segment.
2.  In the "Add an instruction" dropdown, choose the **"Reuse Test"** action.
3.  From the new dropdown that appears, select the name of the segment you want to add (e.g., "Login Flow").

This will insert all the steps from that segment directly into your current test.
