title: "AI Script"
description: "Execute complex or custom actions using a plain-English prompt"
---

## Usecase

**Purpose:** This is your most flexible AI action, designed to perform custom tasks that are not covered by the standard (no-code) instructions. If you feel restricted by the other actions, you can use this to write a command in plain English.

This option is available under the "Add an instruction" dropdown.

---

### Arguments

This action requires two inputs:

* **Enter Description here:** A plain-English overview of what your prompt is supposed to do (e.g., "Find the third item and click delete"). This is for your own reference to keep the test readable.
* **Enter your prompt here:** The actual plain-English command you want the AI to perform (e.g., "Scroll to the 'Get Started' button and click it").
