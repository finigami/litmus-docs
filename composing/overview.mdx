## Writing your First Script
![Test script](/images/running/start.png)  
1.  Begin on the script creation page, where you will find an option to "Enter URL".  
2.  Enter your website's URL into the provided field to load the page.  
3.  Once the page loads, you can add subsequent steps (like clicks, text input, etc.)  
 to build out your test script.  

## Adding Instructions to your Test  
![Test script](/images/running/add_instruction.png)  
1.  After loading your URL, "Compose Mode" becomes active, prompting you to add your first instruction.  
2.  All available automation actions (such as 'Click', 'Type', 'Assert') are listed under the **"Add an instruction"** dropdown.  
3.  Select an action (e.g., "Click"). You can then either choose from a list of already saved elements or use the AI prompt to find a
    new one (e.g., "Click on Add task CTA"). After you click 'Add', the script will perform the action.  

## Saving a Test

    to your test and Save it.

    saving the test.
