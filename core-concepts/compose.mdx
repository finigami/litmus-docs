## What is Compose?

**Compose** is LitmusCheck's interactive test creation mode that allows you to build tests using natural language instructions while watching them execute in real-time. It provides a side-by-side view where you can see your test steps being performed on a live browser, making test creation intuitive and visual.

Compose mode bridges the gap between test design and execution, enabling you to create reliable end-to-end tests without writing code manually. You describe what you want to test in plain English, and LitmusCheck translates your instructions into executable test steps.

## Key Features

### 1. **Live Visual Execution**
- Watch your test steps execute in real-time as you add them
- See exactly how each action interacts with your application
- Validate that your test behaves correctly before saving

### 2. **Natural Language Instructions**
- Write test steps in plain English (e.g., "Click on the login button")
- No need to write code or memorize complex selectors
- AI-powered element detection understands your intent

### 3. **Interactive Test Building**
- Add, edit, delete, and reorder steps with drag-and-drop
- Stop execution at any time to make changes
- Rerun tests from the beginning to verify changes

### 4. **AI-Powered Element Detection**
- Use AI prompts to find elements on the page
- Choose between generating stable selectors or dynamic AI execution
- Save detected elements for reuse across tests

### 5. **Immediate Feedback**
- See step-by-step execution status (success, failure, pending)
- Identify issues immediately during test creation
- Debug and fix problems in real-time

## How Compose Works

1. **Enter a URL**: Load your application in the Compose browser
2. **Add Instructions**: Select actions from the dropdown (Click, Type, Verify, etc.)
3. **Watch Execution**: Each step executes immediately after being added
4. **Refine Steps**: Edit, reorder, or delete steps as needed
5. **Save Test**: Once satisfied, save your test for future runs

## Use Cases

- **Rapid Test Creation**: Build tests quickly without writing code
- **Visual Validation**: Ensure tests work correctly before committing them
- **Exploratory Testing**: Discover and document test scenarios interactively
- **Test Maintenance**: Update existing tests by watching them execute and making adjustments

---

## Best Practices

- **Use Stable Selectors**: When AI finds elements, prefer saving them as reusable elements rather than using dynamic AI execution for better reliability
- **Test Incrementally**: Add a few steps at a time and verify they work before adding more
- **Use Rerun**: Regularly rerun your test from the beginning to catch regressions
- **Save Frequently**: Save your work periodically to avoid losing progress
