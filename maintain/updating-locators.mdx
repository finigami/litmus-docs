## Resolving Failure Due to Flaky/Changed Elements

When your UI changes, a test step can fail because its locator (selector) is flaky or out-of-date. Here is the process to find and fix the broken step.

## How to Update a Failing Locator (Simple Fix)

Use this method to quickly fix a single step in a single test.

1.  Select the test that is failing and go to **Compose Mode**.
2.  Re-run the test. The test will stop at the step that is failing (e.g., "Element not found").
3.  Now that you've found the failing step, hover over it. Three dots (the options menu) will appear.
4.  Click the three dots and select **"Edit"**.
5.  You can now update the locator. You have two choices:
    * **Use a New Prompt:** Write a new, more specific AI prompt for the "New Element" option.
    * **Use an Existing Element:** Select a different, pre-saved "Existing Element" from the dropdown.
6.  Save the step.

## How to Update an Existing POM (Saved) Element

When a **saved element** (a POM element) breaks, you want to fix it *once* and have that fix apply everywhere. Here are the two primary methods to do this.

### Method 1: The "Update Existing" Flow (Recommended)

This is the cleanest and most direct method.

1.  Go to **Compose Mode** for any test that uses the broken saved element.
2.  Hover over the failing step, click the three dots, and select **"Edit"**.
3.  Regenerate the step by selecting **"New Element"** and entering a new, working prompt.
4.  Once the step runs successfully, click to **"Save to Store"** (just as you did when creating an element).
5.  In the "Save to Store" dialog, instead of creating a new element, select the **"Update existing"** option.
6.  From the dropdown, choose the old, broken saved element that you want to replace.
7.  Saving this will overwrite the old, flaky selector with your new, working one, fixing it across all tests.

### Method 2: The "Save and Merge" Flow

This is a good alternative if you want to be more cautious.

1.  Follow steps 1-3 from Method 1.
2.  Instead of "Update existing," save the working step as a **brand new element** (e.g., "Login Button V2").
3.  Now, go to the main **"Elements"** tab from the navigation.
4.  Find your old, broken element (e.g., "Login Button").
5.  Select the **"Merge"** option and merge the old, broken element *into* your new, working one ("Login Button V2"). This will update all tests to use the new element.
