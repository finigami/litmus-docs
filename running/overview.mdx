## Running and Monitoring

### 3 ways to run suites
1. Manually from the dashboard
2. Scheduling
3. Integrating with the CI/CD pipeline

Individual tests can only be run from the dashboard - on the suite page or test page

### Monitoring artifacts
Runs create the following artifacts
- Suite run report with pass/fail summary
- Logs for each test run
- Browser traces for every test
- GIF created from screenshots during each test run

## Setting up slack alerts  
1. Go to **Settings** (top nav bar).  
2. Enter your Slack channel webhook URL.  
3. Click **Save**.

You’ll receive alerts with pass/fail/skip counts and details on failed or skipped tests.
